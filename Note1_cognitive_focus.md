# Inferring Cognitive Focus from Students' Programs

## Analysis of Programs  

1. During coding, students have a lot of choices to make, but the choices are strongly influenced by the language in which the student is coding, but also influenced by the student's perspective on computring and the concerns the student emphasize.
2. variables:  
    + names for procedures and variables  
    + choice of logical constructs, modularization
    + design of user interaction, and documentation of processs.  

### Modularization  

1. division of problem:
    + linearly: **one level, along the path**  
    + hierarchically: **subdivison**  
2. variable and function names convey the perceived purpose of the function, thus the way how to solve the problem.  
    + novice programmers tend to choose verb or verb_like names to name a function.(process_scores)  
    + noun_like names imply that the programs is seeing program as a thing, verb_like names show perception of the program as a dynamic process.
    + largely depend on the instuctors' thinking mode.  
3. student's application of modularization reflects his or her perception of breaks a problem into subproblems than others do.

### Variable Names  

1. file_names can indicate whether the file is part of the system rather than a self-contained unit(AFILE, BFILE).  
    + isolated vs be in a context  
2. to piece of data:
    + entity vs aggregate points.  
    + the tendency to focus on detail ve the tendency to focus on larger units.  
    + By psychologists, the more aggregated ides show students' tendency to become more expert in a knowledge area.  

### Logical Consturcts  

1. structure of data:
    explicit display of infomation vs mathematical relationships  
2. passing of parameters:
    pass an array vs pass an index
    changing focus from larger to smaller units of logical structuring.  

### Program documentation  

1. common frequent words to some students but not others.
    (mix levels of details)  
2. concern for huaman communication.
    to a person vs to a programmer or self-reminders  
3. find traces of the programmer's focus on detail or on abstract conceptual units.  

### what is programming ability  

1. manage the details  
2. manage abstract conceptual units  

### Some future application  

1. teachers can try to influence student's level of focus through through instruction. 
2. which mode of thinking(context or isolate, linear or hierachilly) can most contribute to learning code quickly.  
3. computing is a combination of a human activity and a machine activity. linked to human maybe better at doing the product while linke to machine maybe a better engineer.  
4. conflicts means beuaty and some customed ways to teach.
